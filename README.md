SyncOps - Kubernetes GitOps Dashboard 🚀

SyncOps is a GitOps-powered Kubernetes dashboard that leverages ArgoCD, AWS, Terraform, and GitHub Actions to automate deployments, monitor clusters, and streamline DevOps workflows. This project aims to simplify Kubernetes application management while providing visibility into deployments.

- 🌟 Features
GitOps-driven Deployment – Uses ArgoCD to sync applications automatically from a Git repository.
Automated CI/CD Pipeline – GitHub Actions for building and deploying Docker images.
Infrastructure as Code – Terraform provisions Kubernetes clusters on AWS.
Monitoring & Visualization – Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and real-time dashboards.
Secure & Scalable – Implements RBAC for access control and supports multi-environment deployments.

- 🛠️ Tech Stack
Kubernetes – Container orchestration
ArgoCD – GitOps continuous deployment
Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
AWS EKS – Managed Kubernetes service
GitHub Actions – CI/CD automation
Docker – Containerization
Prometheus & Grafana – Monitoring and visualization

- 🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Prerequisites:
AWS CLI installed and configured
Terraform (latest version)
kubectl and k9s for managing Kubernetes
ArgoCD CLI installed (brew install argocd on macOS)
Docker & GitHub CLI installed

2️⃣ Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Orel-Danilov/SyncOps.git
cd SyncOps

3️⃣ Deploy Infrastructure on AWS:
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply

4️⃣ Configure ArgoCD:
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
argocd login localhost:8080

5️⃣ Deploy Applications
kubectl apply -f manifests/

6️⃣ Monitor Your Cluster
Access ArgoCD Dashboard: https://localhost:8080
Check Grafana: kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000

-📊 Monitoring & Observability

Prometheus scrapes cluster metrics.
Grafana provides real-time visualization.
ArgoCD UI offers deployment insights.

-🛡️ Security Best Practices

RBAC Policies – Restrict user access to Kubernetes resources.
Secret Management – Uses Kubernetes Secrets and Vault (optional).
ArgoCD Authentication – Configured with OAuth or SSO.

-📜 Roadmap

✅ Setup AWS EKS with Terraform
✅ Implement GitOps workflow with ArgoCD
✅ Deploy sample application
☑️ Enhance monitoring with custom Grafana dashboards
☑️ Implement automated rollbacks
☑️ Add Helm support for app deployment
